A pubsub hub for data.gouv.fr.

> Ch√¢telet‚ÄìLes Halles (French: [ É…ëtl…õ le al]) is a major train hub in Paris and one of the largest underground stations in the world. Opened in 1977, it is the central transit hub for the √éle-de-France metropolitan area, connecting three of five RER commuter-rail lines and five of sixteen M√©tro lines. The hub hosts 750,000 travellers per weekday (493,000 for the RER alone) and platforms separated by up to 800 metres (0.49-mile). It is named after the nearby Place du Ch√¢telet public square and the Forum des Halles, a shopping mall.
