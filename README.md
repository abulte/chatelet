> ChÃ¢teletâ€“Les Halles (French: [ÊƒÉ‘tlÉ› le al]) is a major train hub in Paris and one of the largest underground stations in the world. Opened in 1977, it is the central transit hub for the ÃŽle-de-France metropolitan area, connecting three of five RER commuter-rail lines and five of sixteen MÃ©tro lines. The hub hosts 750,000 travellers per weekday (493,000 for the RER alone) and platforms separated by up to 800 metres (0.49-mile). It is named after the nearby Place du ChÃ¢telet public square and the Forum des Halles, a shopping mall.
